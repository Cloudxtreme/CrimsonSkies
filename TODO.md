To Do List
==========

This is my to do list, mostly will be things big and small as I think about them.

  - Add custom recall field for each clan in the tables struct.
  - Add command so anyone can go loner.
  - Create a branch that is bare bones (one area, skills and spells removed, etc so that you can 
    start with a working code base that literally has to be built from the ground up with the 
    exception of the plumping for socket server, pfile handling, area loading, that are necessary
    for it to run)
  - Keep lope's color but removed the other customized colors.  This can predominately be done via clients these days and something is buggy with it, throwing memory allocation errors.
  - Make blink in comm.c immortal only.

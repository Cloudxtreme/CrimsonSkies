To Do List
==========

This is my to do list, mostly will be things big and small as I think about them.

  - Add custom recall field for each clan in the tables struct.
  - Add command so anyone can go loner.
  - Create a branch that is bare bones (one area, skills and spells removed, etc so that you can 
    start with a working code base that literally has to be built from the ground up with the 
    exception of the plumping for socket server, pfile handling, area loading, that are necessary
    for it to run)
  - Make blink in comm.c immortal only.
  - OLC chopped off characters in name in area name after asave area.
  - Fix send_to_desc and the bug with d->ansi.  Something is jacked up causing it to not work after copyover's or just not work in some cases.

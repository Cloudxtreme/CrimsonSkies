Changes made for Windows support (Tested on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 with Visual Studio 2013)

Visual Studio Project Changes

To fix sprintf errors in VS:
    - Project Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Defintions
    - Add Disable _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE 

To fix net errors add winsock:
    - Project Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
    - Add wsock32.lib

To fix:
	- Error C4996: 'unlink': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _unlink
	- Put _WIN32 directive in to call _unlink for Windows, link for anything else

To fix:
	- Error C4996: 'close': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _close
	- Put _WIN32 directive in to call _close for Windows, link for anything else

To fix:
    - error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'sys/time.h': No such file or directory
	- Put directives in all files for _WIN32 to point to time.h.  A pain but I want to do it in the code and not be copying
	  to the sys directory so this works out of the box for people who fork it.

To fix:
	- error C2079: 'now_time' uses undefined struct 'timeval'
	- Add _WIN32 include for winsock.h

To fix:
	- error C4996: 'write': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _write. See online help for details.	
	- Add _WIN32 code and change write to _write

Additional Notes:

	- The crypt function isn't working currently under _WIN32.  Be very aware of that.  If you're just using this for debugging purposes like I am then no biggy.

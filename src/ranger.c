 *  Rangers are warriors who are associated with the wisdom of nature.     *
 *  They tend to be wise, cunning, and perceptive in addition to being     *
 *  skilled woodsmen. Many are skilled in stealth, wilderness survival,    *
 *  beast-mastery, herbalism, and tracking.  They are adept at swordplay   *
 *  and fight much better in a wilderness setting.  Rangers typically have *
 *  keen eye sight and are excellent at hiding in forest areas.            *
